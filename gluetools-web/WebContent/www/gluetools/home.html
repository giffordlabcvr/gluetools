<h2>GLUEtools</h2>

<h3>Mission statement</h3>
<em>A software package for developing nucleotide-level evolutionary hypotheses for virus and endogenous viral element (EVE) genomes.
It enables the dissemination of these hypotheses on the web and the utilisation of the hypotheses in wider software systems. 
</em>

<h3>Design overview</h3>
At the heart of GLUEtools is an <a href="#model">entity-relationship model</a> which has been designed for representing:
<ul>
<li>Virus and EVE genome data</li>
<li>Phenotypic and other data associated with specific sequences</li>
<li>Genomic feature annotations</li>
<li>The nucleotide-level proposed evolutionary relationships between genomes</li>
<li>Configurable modules for manipulation and analysis of the data</li>
</ul>
Data hosted inside a GLUEtools instance is organised into independent <em>projects</em>. 

Typical activities associated with developing a GLUEtools project:
<ul>
<li>Import sequence data into GLUEtools from a public database or elsewhere</li>
<li>Define relevant additional sequence data fields and obtaining corrected / normalised values for these fields</li>
<li>Filter out certain sequences from the project</li>
<li>Select reference sequences and define genomic features on these references</li>
<li>Apply sequence alignment techniques to capture homologies between genome segments</li>
<li>Arrange data into evolutionary clades and define relationships between these clades</li>
<li>Define project-specific analysis modules</li>
</ul>

Once a project has been developed, it can be published as a web resource, which allows:
<ul>
<li><i>Dissemination</i> of the project data, for example in conjunction with an academic publication</li>
<li><i>Utilisation</i> of the project for automated sequence analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software architecture</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) 
of GLUEtools is a rich, extensive set of <em>commands</em> for developing, querying and analysing its model. 
</p>

<p>The GLUEtools engine may be run using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command line interface</a> (CLI), in which case the commands may be executed interactively or from files.
</p>

<p>Alternatively the GLUEtools engine may be integrated into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container">web container</a>, 
in which case the commands may be executed via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Representational State Transfer</a> (REST) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web service</a> interactions.


<p>GLUEtools is implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>. 
However, it should not be viewed as a Java library, as it is not intended that other systems will interface directly with the Java code. The command set is the supported API, there is no Java API.</p>


<p>GLUEtools is database-centric. The GLUEtools Java engine relies on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">Relational Database Management System</a> (RDBMS) such as <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or 
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a>. All aspects of a GLUEtools project are stored in this database.
