<h2>GLUEtools</h2>

<h3>Mission statement</h3>
<em>A software package for developing, disseminating and utilising detailed hypotheses concerning the evolution of virus and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_viral_element">EVE</a> genomes.</em>

<h3>Design overview</h3>
At the heart of GLUEtools is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">entity-relationship</a> <a href="#model">model</a> which has been designed for representing:
<ul>
<li>Virus and EVE genome data</li>
<li>Phenotypic and other data associated with specific sequences</li>
<li>Genomic feature annotations</li>
<li>The detailed proposed evolutionary relationships between genomes</li>
<li>Configurable modules for advanced manipulation and analysis of the data</li>
</ul>
Data hosted inside a GLUEtools instance is organised into independent <em>projects</em>. 

Typical activities associated with developing a GLUEtools project:
<ul>
<li>Import sequence data into GLUEtools from a public database or elsewhere</li>
<li>Define relevant additional sequence data fields and obtaining corrected / normalised values for these fields</li>
<li>Filter out irrelevant sequences</li>
<li>Select reference sequences and define genomic features on these references</li>
<li>Apply sequence alignment techniques to capture homologies between genome segments</li>
<li>Arrange data into evolutionary clades and define relationships between these clades</li>
<li>Define project-specific analysis modules</li>
</ul>

Once a project has been developed, it can be published as a web resource, which allows:
<ul>
<li><i>Dissemination</i> of the project data, for example in conjunction with an academic publication</li>
<li><i>Utilisation</i> of the project for automated sequence analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software architecture</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> 
of GLUEtools is a rich, extensive set of <em>commands</em> for developing, querying and analysing its model. 
</p>

<p>The GLUEtools engine may be run in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command line mode</a>, in which case the commands may be executed interactively or from files.
</p>

<p>Alternatively the GLUEtools engine may be integrated into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container">web container</a>, 
in which case the commands may be executed via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web service</a> interactions.


<p>GLUEtools is implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>. 
However, it should not be viewed as a Java library, as it is not intended that other systems will interface directly with the Java code. The command set is the supported API, there is no Java API.</p>


<p>GLUEtools is database-centric. The GLUEtools Java engine relies on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">RDBMS</a> such as <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or 
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a>. All aspects of a GLUEtools project are stored in this database.
