<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application Programming Interface</a> (API) 
of GLUE is a rich, extensive set of <em>commands</em> for developing, querying and analysing its model. 
</p>

<p>The GLUE engine may be run using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command line interface</a> (CLI), in which case the commands may be executed interactively or from files.
</p>

<p>Alternatively the GLUE engine may be integrated into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container">web container</a>, 
in which case the commands may be executed via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Representational State Transfer</a> (REST) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web service</a> interactions.


<p>GLUE is implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>. 
However, it should not be viewed as a Java library, as it is not intended that other systems will interface directly with the Java code. The command set is the supported API, there is no Java API.</p>


<p>GLUE is database-centric. The GLUE Java engine relies on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">Relational Database Management System</a> (RDBMS) such as <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> or 
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a>. All aspects of a GLUE project are stored in this database.
