<h3 id="long-term-support">Long Term Support</h3>
<p>On July 1st 2018, we will enter a Long Term Support period for AngularJS.</p>
<p>At this time we will focus exclusively on providing fixes to bugs that satisfy at least one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>A security flaw is detected in the 1.7.x branch of the framework</li>
<li>One of the major browsers releases a version that will cause current production applications using AngularJS 1.7.x to stop working</li>
<li>The jQuery library releases a version that will cause current production applications using AngularJS 1.7.x to stop working.</li>
</ul>
