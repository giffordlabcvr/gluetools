  # import unconstrained alignment  
  # The alignment is based on Smith, et. al 2016, but has also been modified to:
  # 1. Replace internal NN's with --'s for KJ873911 in order to make blast fasta importer work properly.
  # 2. Add a row for sequence RR_L08816 -- this sequence is present in order to provide feature locations
  # 3. The missing subtype has been added for JQ013791 (3ra) KJ013415 (3ra) and EU723513 (3f)
