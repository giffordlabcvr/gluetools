	<!-- The minimum bit score setting here was added in order to 
	     prevent alignment of the query to parts of the reference that are self-similar.
	     Specifically, it was found that two 50 nucleotide segments of reference M73218 are similar enough that
	     a spurious blast hit is generated on query EU879105.
	     
	     However, this spurious hit has a much lower bit score, so the bit score filter will remove it.
	     
	     This approach here is fine as the reference self-similarity is not extreme and we are aligning queries which 
	     are closely related and similar to the reference.
	     
	     Incidentally, the problem showed up during a routine check using the alignment show statistics command: 
	     this particular member had a memberNtCoveragePct of > 100%
