  <!-- This element is optional. It controls how the GLUE sequence is identified from the alignment FASTA sequence ID. 
       If omitted, the whole FASTA ID is matched against the GLUE sequenceID.
       If present, the matchPattern regex is matched against the FASTA ID to generate capture group values.
       The outputTemplate element then contains a Freemarker template which creates a GLUE sequence lookup where-clause, 
       which should identify exactly one sequence -->
