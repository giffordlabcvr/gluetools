UNABLE_TO_DETECT_ALIGNMENT_NAME=Unable to detect alignment name from sequence header \"{0}\"
FEATURE_CODON_NUMBERING_MISMATCH=Feature codon numbering mismatch: For ORF feature {0} codon 1 is at NT {2}, but for descendent feature {1}, codon 1 is at NT {3}. The difference is not a multiple of 3.
ORF_MUST_HAVE_SINGLE_SEGMENT=ORF feature {0} has {1} reference segments. It should have exactly 1.
ORF_INCOMPLETE_TRANSCRIPTION=Transcription of ORF feature {0} produced an amino acid string of length {1}; a length of {2} was expected. 
ORF_LENGTH_NOT_MULTIPLE_OF_3=ORF feature {0} segment length {1} is not a multiple of 3.
