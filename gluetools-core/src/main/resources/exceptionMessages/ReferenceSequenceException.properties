REFERENCE_SEQUENCE_DOES_NOT_CONSTRAIN_ANY_ALIGNMENT=Reference sequence {0} does not constrain any alignment
REFERENCE_SEQUENCE_CONSTRAINS_MULTIPLE_ALIGNMENTS=Reference sequence {0} constrains multiple alignments
REFERENCE_SEQUENCE_MEMBER_OF_MULTIPLE_TIP_ALIGNMENTS=Reference sequence {0} is a member of multiple tip alignments
REFERENCE_SEQUENCE_MEMBER_OF_NO_TIP_ALIGNMENTS=Reference sequence {0} is a member of no tip alignments
REFERENCE_SEQUENCE_NOT_MEMBER_OF_CONSTRAINED_ALIGNMENT=Reference sequence {0} is not a member of any constrained alignment named {1}
