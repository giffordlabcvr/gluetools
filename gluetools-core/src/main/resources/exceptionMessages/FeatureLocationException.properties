NEXT_ANCESTOR_FEATURE_LOCATION_UNDEFINED=Feature-location {1} in reference sequence {0} is invalid: no location is defined for next ancestor feature {2}
FEATURE_LOCATION_NOT_CONTAINED_WITHIN_NEXT_ANCESTOR=Feature-location {1} in reference sequence {0} is invalid: it is not contained within next ancestor feature location {2}
FEATURE_LOCATION_INVALID_CODON_LABEL=The string "{2}" is not a valid codon label for feature-location {1} in reference sequence {0}. Feature-location command "list labeled-codon" gives the valid list.
FEATURE_LOCATION_HAS_NO_SEGMENTS=Feature-location {1} in reference sequence {0} has no segments
FEATURE_LOCATION_SEGMENT_NOT_CODON_ALIGNED=Segment [{2}, {3}] in feature-location {1} of reference sequence {0} is not codon-aligned to codon 1 start {4}
FEATURE_OR_ANCESTOR_MUST_HAVE_OWN_CODON_NUMBERING=Feature {0} or one of its ancestors must have metatag OWN_CODON_NUMBERING set to 'true'.
FEATURE_LOCATION_MUST_HAVE_SEGMENTS_TO_ESTABLISH_READING_FRAME=Feature location {1} on reference {0} must have segments defined, to establishe the reading frame.
