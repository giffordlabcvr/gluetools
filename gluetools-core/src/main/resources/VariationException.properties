VARIATION_CODON_LOCATION_CAN_NOT_BE_USED_FOR_NUCLEOTIDE_VARIATIONS=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: codon-based locations may not be used if translation type is not AMINO_ACID.
VARIATION_ENDPOINTS_REVERSED=Invalid location of variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: refEnd {4} > refStart {3} 
VARIATION_LOCATION_OUT_OF_RANGE=Invalid location of variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: region [{3}, {4}] is not contained within the feature-location
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_MUST_BE_DEFINED_ON_CODING_FEATURE=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} cannot be of translation type AMINO_ACID: feature {1} does not code for amino acids.
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_HAS_NO_CODON_NUMBERING_ANCESTOR=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} cannot be of translation type AMINO_ACID: there is no ancestor feature with its own codon numbering
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_LOCATION_OUT_OF_RANGE=Amino acid variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: codon {3} is not contained within labeled codon range [{4}, {5}]
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_NOT_CODON_ALIGNED=Amino acid variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: endpoints [{3},{4}] are not codon-aligned
VARIATION_LOCATION_UNDEFINED=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} does not have a fully defined location on the reference
VARIATION_REGEX_UNDEFINED=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} has no defined regex
