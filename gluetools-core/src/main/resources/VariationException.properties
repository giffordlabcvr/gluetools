VARIATION_LOCATION_OUT_OF_RANGE=Invalid location of variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: region [{3}, {4}] is not contained within the feature-location
VARIATION_ENDPOINTS_REVERSED=Invalid location of variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: refEnd {4} > refStart {3} 
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_MUST_BE_DEFINED_IN_ORF=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} cannot be of transcription type AMINO_ACID: feature {1} is not the descendent of any ORF
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_HAS_NO_CODON_NUMBERING_ANCESTOR=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} cannot be of transcription type AMINO_ACID: there is no ancestor feature with its own codon numbering
AMINO_ACID_VARIATION_LOCATION_OUT_OF_RANGE=Amino acid variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0}: region [{4}, {5}] is not contained within codon numbering range [1, {6}] defined by feature-location {3}
VARIATION_LOCATION_UNDEFINED=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} does not have a fully defined location on the reference
VARIATION_REGEX_UNDEFINED=Variation {2} in feature-location {1} of reference {0} has no defined regex
