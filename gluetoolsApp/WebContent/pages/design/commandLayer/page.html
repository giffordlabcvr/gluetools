Under construction.

<!-- 
-- all interactions with a live GLUE project are done via the command layer

-- the command layer may be accessed
	-- via the interactive command line
	-- via JSON over HTTP (when GLUE is running in a web server)
	-- from the scripting layer.
	-- most commands can be accessed from any of these.

-- some commands are in modes
-- some commands can be executed in any mode
-- some commands are in modules

-- commands have a document-in document-out interface -- show how this can be investigated.

-- the input document may often be constructed from a text string, as with the interactive command line.

-- output document can be rendered as XML, JSON, text or sometimes an interactive table.
