			A set of FASTA virus nucleotide sequences forms the foundation of
			each GLUE project data set. Each GLUE <em>Sequence</em> object is
			assumed to be a section of viral RNA or DNA. Sequences may originate
			from any laboratory sequencing technique as long as FASTA nucleotide
			data is produced. Sequences may also be in silico constructs, such
			ancestral reconstructions, or consensus sequences which are each
			representatives of a larger set. A <em>Sequence</em> object may cover
			the whole of the virus genome, or only a part, and may be have
			unknown subregions, indicated by the ‘N’ character. For endogenous
			viruses a <em>Sequence</em> may cover some local areas of host
			nucleotide sequence, beyond the virus genome.
		</p>
		<p>
			Within a GLUE project, <em>Sequences</em> must be stored within
			<em>Source</em> objects. These exist purely to group sequences; the meaning or usage of
			these groups is left to the project developer.
			<em>Sequences</em> are identified by their 
			<em>sequenceID</em> string field. However, the uniqueness of the 
			<em>sequenceID</em> value is limited to the containing <em>Source</em> object.
			So, no two <em>Sequences</em> within the same <em>Source</em> may have the same 
			<em>sequenceID</em>; conversely two <em>Sequences</em> within two different <em>Sources</em>
			may have the same <em>sequenceID</em>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Sequences</em> may be imported into GLUE from multiple file formats. The 
			specific format is recorded in a field value on the <em>Sequence</em> object, 
			and the original file data is stored in the database in byte form. The aim of this is to 
			allow retrieval of any non-nucleotide data which may be present in the original file.
			The original file, including the nucleotide data is immutable for the
			lifetime of the <em>Sequence</em> object.

<h3 id="Features"><em>Features</em></h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8">
		<p>
		For many virus species, biological properties of certain named regions
		of the virus genome have been suggested or established. Within a GLUE
		project, <em>Feature</em> objects may be created for any genomic region of
		interest. Examples include regions which are understood to code for
		polyproteins or individual proteins, or regions which code for domains
		within a protein. <em>Feature</em> objects may also represent non-coding regions
		such as promoter regions. The <em>Feature</em> objects in a GLUE project may be
		arranged in a hierarchy, with each <em>Feature</em> optionally having a single
		parent <em>Feature</em> object and several child <em>Feature</em> objects associated. This
		should reflect the containment relationships of the corresponding genome
		regions. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<em>Feature</em> objects may also have <em>FeatureMetatag</em> objects
		associated. These are simple metadata properties, with fixed semantics,
		which allow specialized GLUE functionality to interpret <em>Feature</em> objects,
		for example to perform protein translation.

<p>
GLUE uses <em>ReferenceSequence</em> objects to organize, link and interpret the
wider set of <em>Sequence</em> objects. A <em>ReferenceSequence</em> is based on a
specific <em>Sequence</em> and this relationship is mandatory and immutable for
the lifetime of the <em>ReferenceSequence</em>. The choice of which <em>Sequence</em>
objects to use for <em>ReferenceSequence</em> objects will vary from project to
project, some examples are:
<ul>
	<li>Sequences which have been curated as reference sequences by
		another database, e.g. NCBI RefSeq</li>
	<li>Sequences derived from well-known virus strains which were
		identified early in the study of a particular virus species or subtype</li>
	<li>Sequences derived from virus strains which have become
		established as having important laboratory uses</li>
	<li>Sequences where the genome is particularly well-annotated.
		Less frequently, sequences derived from an <em>in silico</em> procedure such as
		computing the consensus of a wider set, or ancestral reconstruction</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A <em>ReferenceSequence</em> object may contain <em>FeatureLocation</em> objects in order
to represent the presence and position of a specific <em>Feature</em> on the
<em>ReferenceSequence</em>. A <em>FeatureLocation</em> is considered a wholly contained
constituent part of a <em>ReferenceSequence</em>, but it is also immutably
associated with a single <em>Feature</em> during its lifetime. 
</p>
<p>
A certain <em>Feature</em>
may not be present (i.e. be associated with a <em>FeatureLocation</em>) on every
<em>ReferenceSequence</em> in the GLUE project. This flexibility may be useful
for example when specific virus genes exist only in some taxa within the
project scope. 
</p>
<p>
A <em>FeatureLocation</em> contains a set of <em>FeatureSegment</em>
objects which specify the coordinates of the relevant <em>Feature</em> on the
<em>ReferenceSequence</em>. The <em>FeatureSegment</em> objects contain start and end
points, and together may specify a discontiguous region.

<h3 id="Alignments"><em>Alignments</em> and <em>AlignmentMembers</em></h3>

<p>One key aspect which GLUE projects aim to capture is the
	representation of nucleotide homologies between <em>Sequence</em> objects. At a
	fine-grained level, these homologies may be thought of as statements
	proposing that a certain segment of nucleotides in one <em>Sequence</em> has the
	same evolutionary origin as a certain segment in a second <em>Sequence</em>.</p>

<p><em>Alignment</em> objects in GLUE aggregate homologies relating to a set
	of “member” <em>Sequence</em> objects that are associated to the <em>Alignment</em> via
	<em>AlignmentMember</em> objects. So in concrete terms an <em>Alignment</em> object
	contains a set of <em>AlignmentMember</em> objects and each <em>AlignmentMember</em>
	associates a member <em>Sequence</em> with the containing <em>Alignment</em>.</p>

<p>Within an <em>Alignment</em> all homologies use the same reference
	coordinate space. Each <em>AlignmentMember</em> in turn contains a set of
	<em>AlignedSegment</em> objects, which are each statements of homology between
	the member <em>Sequence</em> nucleotides and the reference coordinate space of
	the <em>Alignment</em>. To represent this, the <em>AlignedSegment</em> is a tuple with
	four integer fields:</p>
<p>
<em>&lt;refStart, refEnd, memberStart, memberEnd&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>
	This states that the region [<em>memberStart</em>, <em>memberEnd</em>]
	in the member <em>Sequence</em> is homologous with the region [<em>refStart</em>,
	<em>refEnd</em>] in the reference coordinate space of the containing
	<em>Alignment</em>. An invariant maintained by GLUE is that these two regions
	must be of equal length.
</p>
<p>This reference coordinate space associated with an <em>Alignment</em>
	object is used as an indirect step relating the member sequence
	nucleotides with each other. So, two blocks of nucleotides from
	distinct member <em>Sequence</em> objects within an <em>Alignment</em> are considered to
	be homologous when they are mapped via <em>AlignedSegment</em> objects to the
	same reference coordinates.</p>
<p><em>Alignment</em> objects may be unconstrained or constrained.
	Unconstrained <em>Alignments</em> are used in GLUE projects to store the results
	of any multiple sequence alignment process aimed at identifying
	homologies between sequences. This includes classical algorithms such
	as MUSCLE or MAFFT but also manual alignment techniques. In
	unconstrained alignments the reference coordinate space is purely
	notional, and not based on any particular <em>Sequence</em>. Nucleotide position
	columns in an this coordinate space may be added in an unrestricted way
	in order to accommodate any pairwise homology between member <em>Sequence</em>
	objects which the alignment process proposes.</p>
<p><em>Sequence</em> objects may be members of multiple <em>Alignments</em>, via
	different <em>AlignmentMember</em> associations. One application of this is
	where separate unconstrained <em>Alignment</em> objects are used to represent
	homologies in different regions of the virus genome. This may be
	appropriate for example if the best alignment technique differs from
	one genomic region to another.</p>
<p>The main function of a <em>ReferenceSequence</em> in GLUE is to provide a
	concrete coordinate space in which the nucleotide data in <em>Sequence</em>
	objects may be interpreted. As an alternative to being unconstrained,
	<em>Alignment</em> objects may be constrained to a <em>ReferenceSequence</em>. In this
	case, the nucleotide <em>Sequence</em> underlying the constraining
	<em>ReferenceSequence</em> provides the reference coordinate space for the
	constrained <em>Alignment</em>. Therefore, <em>AlignedSegment</em> objects within a
	constrained <em>Alignment</em> propose homology between a nucleotide block on
	the member <em>Sequence</em> and an equal-length block on the constraining
	<em>ReferenceSequence</em>.</p>
<p>[Stylized diagram illustrating constrained vs unconstrained
	alignments?]</p>
<p>The <em>AlignedSegment</em> objects within constrained <em>Alignment</em> objects
	may be derived from those within unconstrained <em>Alignment</em> objects where
	both the member and reference sequences are present. However, where the
	member sequences of the constrained <em>Alignment</em> are known to be closely
	related to the <em>ReferenceSequence</em>, another possibility exists. In this
	case the constrained <em>Alignment</em> homologies may be computed using a
	simple pairwise technique between the member and reference sequence,
	for example based on BLAST.</p>
