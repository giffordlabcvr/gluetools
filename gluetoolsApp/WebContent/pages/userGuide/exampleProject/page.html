<p>Conventionally, files relating to GLUE projects are stored in their own directories, which are inside the <code>gluetools/projects</code> directory. 
Download the example project zip from the <a target="_blank" href="#download">GLUE download page</a>. Unzip it inside <code>gluetools/projects</code>.</p>

<p>We can now start a GLUE interactive session and build the example project. This requires the BLAST+ integration.</p>
<p>If the project build was successful, the last output before the GLUE prompt should be "OK".</p>

$ cd /home/fred/gluetools/projects/exampleProject
