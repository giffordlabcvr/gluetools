<p>In GLUE, a <b>project</b> is a self-contained package containing data
and analysis functions which relate to a certain set of virus sequences. 
This example project, based on hepatitis E virus (HEV), has been designed
to illustrate many of the key features of GLUE. </p>

<h3 id="download">Download and unpack</h3>

<p>Conventionally, files relating to GLUE projects are each stored in their own directories, which are inside the <code>gluetools/projects</code> directory. 
Download the example project zip from the <a target="_blank" href="#download">GLUE download page</a>. Unzip it inside <code>gluetools/projects</code>.</p>

<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
$ cd /home/fred/gluetools/projects
$ unzip exampleProject-0.1.136.zip</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="build">Build the project</h3>

<p>
While a project is archived as a set of files, in order to use the project within GLUE we have to <b>build</b> it. 
Building a project means asking GLUE to run a series of commands which will load all the project data and analysis 
functions into the GLUE instance, performing any necessary processing of this data.</p>

<p>We can now start a GLUE interactive session and build the example project. We will do this by executing the 
<glue-command url="#/nonModeCommands/command/run_file"></glue-command> command on the file 
<code>exampleProject.glue</code>. This is the <b>master build file</b>
for the project.</p>

<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
$ cd /home/fred/gluetools/projects/exampleProject
$ gluetools.sh
GLUE version 0.1.136
Mode path: /
GLUE> run file exampleProject.glue
...</pre>
</div>
<p>As the build runs, you will see a lot of text generated by GLUE as various commands are executed.</p>

<p>The example project build uses BLAST+, MAFFT and RAxML at various stages, so if any of these software integrations
are not working properly the build may report an error. In this case check the <a href="#installation">installation 
instructions</a>. If all else fails raise a question on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/glue-support">GLUE support forum</a>.</p>

<p>If the project build was successful, the output should end with "OK" as shown below.</p>

<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
...
OK
Mode path: /
GLUE></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="nextSteps">Next steps</h3>

Now, follow the <a href="#interactiveCommandLine">command line interpreter</a> tutorial, which will explain the basics of how 
to query the GLUE project and use it to run analysis.
