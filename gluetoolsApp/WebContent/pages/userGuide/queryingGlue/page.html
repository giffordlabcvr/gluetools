<h2>{{queryingGlueMenuTitle}}</h2>
<p>
GLUE allows powerful queries to be run on the stored data, using a few simple concepts and command patterns.
These can be used simply to extract data subsets, to ask simple research questions, or as part of a more complex analysis. 
To understand this section it is useful to be familiar with the <a href="#/coreSchema">core schema</a> and 
<a href="#/schemaExtension">schema extension</a> sections. We will also use the <a href="#/exampleProject">example project</a>
for illustration so it will be useful to have this installed.
</p>
<h3>GLUE "where clauses"</h3>
<p>These are filter expressions which can be used within various GLUE commands with the same basic structure:
<ol>
	<li>Start from some particular set of <b>candidate objects</b> of the same type (i.e. in the same table)</li>
	<li>(Optionally) select a subset of candidate objects</li>
	<li>Perform some operation on the selected objects</li>
</ol>
GLUE "where" clauses are used in step 2 to select a subset of objects, based on a logical filter.
A command with this structure is the <mode-command mode="root_project_alignment" command="amino-acid_frequency"></mode-command> command. 
This command is executed in <a href="#/commandModes/commandMode/root_project_alignment">alignment mode</a>, so a specific <em>Alignment</em>
object is the data context. </p>

| 62    | F         | 3          | 30.00      |
| 63    | W         | 10         | 100.00     |
| 64    | S         | 1          | 10.00      |

<p>
In this case the <em>Alignment</em> AL_MASTER is the data context, and the operation of the command is:
<ol>
	<li>The candidate objects consist of all <em>AlignmentMembers</em> which belong to <em>Alignment</em> AL_MASTER, or (since <code>-c</code> was used) one of its descendent 
	<em>Alignments</em> in the alignment tree</li>
	<li>Select a subset of these <em>AlignmentMembers</em> which pass the where clause filter specified by <code>-w "sequence.source.name = 'ncbi-hev-examples'"</code></li>
	<li>Amongst the selected <em>AlignmentMembers</em>, compute the frequency of amino acid residues in the MT (Methyltransferase) genome region 
	at ORF1 codon positions 56 to 66 inclusive (as specified by the <code>-r</code>, <code>-f</code> and <code>-l</code> options)</li>
</ol>
<p>All the objects identified in step 1 will be <b>tested in step 2 against the where clause</b>; those which pass this filter will then contribute 
to the computation in step 3. </p>
<p>The where clause string <code>sequence.source.name = 'ncbi-hev-examples'</code> is supplied in double quotes in order to allow 
space and single quote characters to be used within the string. </p>
<p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
The first part of the where clause is <code>sequence.source.name</code>.
This is a <b>property path</b>. Starting from the tested object, in this case an 
<em>AlignmentMember</em>, the property path <b>traverses named relational links specified by the data schema</b> in order to arrive at a data value. 
In this case the all links are specified in the <a href="#/coreSchema">core schema</a>; the relevant schema fragment is shown. However
any or all of them could also be specified by a <a href="#/schemaExtension">schema extension</a>.
<ul>
	<li>Start from a candidate <em>AlignmentMember</em></li>
	<li>Traverse the <code>sequence</code> relational link to the target <em>Sequence</em> object</li>
	<li>Traverse the <code>source</code> relational link to the target <em>Source</em> object</li>
	<li>Access the value for the field <code>name</code> on the <em>Source</em> object</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">

</p>
<p>
The where clause expression uses the binary operator '=' to compare the <em>Source</em> name with the literal string 'ncbi-hev-examples', so that only 
<em>AlignmentMembers</em> based on <em>Sequences</em> belongs to <em>Source</em> <code>ncbi-hev-examples</code> are selected. It is also possible to use 
parentheses and logical operators such as 'and', 'not' and 'or' to join sub clauses together.
Here are some where clause patterns you could use in the example project:
