Typical activities associated with developing a GLUE project:
<ul>
<li>Import sequence data into GLUE from a public database or elsewhere</li>
<li>Define relevant additional sequence data fields and obtaining corrected / normalised values for these fields</li>
<li>Filter out certain sequences from the project</li>
<li>Select reference sequences and define genomic features on these references</li>
<li>Apply sequence alignment techniques to capture homologies between genome segments</li>
<li>Arrange data into evolutionary clades and define relationships between these clades</li>
<li>Define project-specific analysis modules</li>
</ul>
