The GLUE interactive command line interpreter is a powerful environment for interacting with the GLUE command layer at a fine-grained level. 
The design could be compared to interactive R or Python interpreters, or an interactive database command line client.

<h4>Basics</h4>

<p>
On starting the GLUE interpreter you will see something like this:
</p>
<p>
<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
GLUE version 0.1.135
Mode path: /
GLUE></pre>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Try entering the commands displayed below:
</p>
<p>
<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
Mode path: /
GLUE> create project myproject
OK
(1 Project created)
Mode path: /
GLUE> list project
+===========+================================+
|   name    |          description           |
+===========+================================+
| myproject | -                              |
+===========+================================+
Projects found: 1
Mode path: /
GLUE></pre>
</div>
</p>
<p>
The above commands created a new project "myproject" and then queried GLUE for a list of projects. Now try the following commands:
</p>
<p>
<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
Mode path: /
GLUE> project myproject 
OK
Mode path: /project/myproject
GLUE> create feature L
OK
(1 Feature created)
Mode path: /project/myproject
GLUE> exit
OK
Mode path: /
GLUE></pre>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Notice that the GLUE interpreter outputs a mode path each time a command is typed. 
The <code>project myproject</code> command changed mode path from "/" to 
"/project/myproject", and the <code>exit</code> command changed it back to "/" again. 
</p>
<p>
The GLUE interpreter provides a <a href="#/commandModes">hierarchy of command modes</a>, based on the 
<a href="#/coreSchema">GLUE data schema</a>. Each command 
mode operates on a specific data object and so has a different set of available commands. We changed the current 
command mode from root mode (which has no data object) to the project mode for "myproject", and then back to root mode again. 
</p>
<p>
The <code>create feature</code> command above created a <em>Feature</em> object "L" within project "myproject", because the 
command was entered within the mode for that project. Most data objects have an associated command mode. The command modes 
are arranged in a hierarchy which represents data object containment. The mode path associated with each mode 
specifies its position in the hierarchy, as shown here as we navigate into the command mode for <em>Feature</em> "L". 
The <code>exit</code> command here changes the current mode from feature "L" mode to its parent, project "myproject" mode.
</p>
<p>
<div hljs language="json" no-escape>
<pre>
Mode path: /
GLUE> project myproject 
OK
Mode path: /project/myproject
GLUE> feature L
OK
Mode path: /project/myproject/feature/L
GLUE>exit
OK
Mode path: /project/myproject
GLUE>exit</pre>
</div>
</p>
