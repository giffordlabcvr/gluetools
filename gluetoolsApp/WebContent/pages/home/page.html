		<p>GLUE is a data-centric bioinformatics environment for virus sequence data, with a focus on variation, evolution and sequence interpretation<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Stored virus nucleotide sequences are organised along evolutionary lines</li>
			<li>Common bioinfomatics operations are supported as standard</li>
			<li>The data schema and bioinformatics functionality can be customised and extended</li>
			<li>Data and functionality can be quickly developed offline then published as part of a web service</li>
