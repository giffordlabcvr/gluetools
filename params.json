It enables the dissemination of these hypotheses on the web and the utilisation of the hypotheses in wider software systems. \r\n\r\n### Design Overview\r\n\r\nAt the heart of GLUEtools is an entity-relationship model which has been designed for representing:\r\n- Virus and EVE genome data\r\n- Phenotypic and other data associated with specific sequences\r\n- Genomic feature annotations\r\n- The nucleotide-level proposed evolutionary relationships between genomes\r\n- Configurable modules for manipulation and analysis of the data\r\n\r\nData hosted inside a GLUEtools instance is organised into independent projects. Typical activities associated with developing a GLUEtools project:\r\n- Import sequence data into GLUEtools from a public database or elsewhere\r\n- Define relevant additional sequence data fields and obtaining corrected / normalised values for these fields\r\n- Filter out certain sequences from the project\r\n- Select reference sequences and define genomic features on these references\r\n- Apply sequence alignment techniques to capture homologies between genome segments\r\n- Arrange data into evolutionary clades and define relationships between these clades\r\n- Define project-specific analysis modules\r\n\r\nOnce a project has been developed, it can be published as a web resource, which allows:\r\n\r\n    Dissemination of the project data, for example in conjunction with an academic publication\r\n    Utilisation of the project for automated sequence analysis\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
