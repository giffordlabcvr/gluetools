  "body": "GLUE is a software package for development of nucleotide-level hypotheses about the evolution of virus genomes. It enables the dissemination of these hypotheses on the web and their utilisation in wider software systems. \r\n\r\n### **Design Overview**\r\n\r\nAt the heart of GLUEtools is an entity-relationship model which has been designed for representing:\r\n\r\n- Virus and EVE genome data\r\n- Phenotypic and other data associated with specific sequences\r\n- Genomic feature annotations\r\n- The nucleotide-level proposed evolutionary relationships between genomes\r\n- Configurable modules for manipulation and analysis of the data\r\n\r\nData hosted inside a GLUEtools instance is organised into independent projects. Typical activities associated with developing a GLUEtools project:\r\n\r\n- Import sequence data into GLUEtools from a public database or elsewhere\r\n- Define relevant additional sequence data fields and obtaining corrected / normalised values for these fields\r\n- Filter out certain sequences from the project\r\n- Select reference sequences and define genomic features on these references\r\n- Apply sequence alignment techniques to capture homologies between genome segments\r\n- Arrange data into evolutionary clades and define relationships between these clades\r\n- Define project-specific analysis modules\r\n\r\nOnce a project has been developed, it can be published as a web resource, which allows:\r\n\r\n- Dissemination of the project data, for example in conjunction with an academic publication\r\n- Utilisation of the project for automated sequence analysis\r\n\r\n### **Software architecture**\r\n\r\nThe [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (API) of GLUEtools is a rich, extensive set of commands for developing, querying and analysing its model.\r\n\r\nThe GLUEtools engine may be run using a [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI), in which case the commands may be executed interactively or from files.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the GLUEtools engine may be integrated into a [web container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container), in which case the commands may be executed via a [Representational State Transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) web service interactions.\r\n\r\nGLUEtools is implemented in Java. However, it should not be viewed as a Java library, as it is not intended that other systems will interface directly with the Java code. The command set is the supported API, there is no Java API.\r\n\r\nGLUEtools is database-centric. The GLUEtools Java engine relies on a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) such as MySQL or Apache Derby. All aspects of a GLUEtools project are stored in this database. \r\n\r\n### **Current GLUE projects**\r\n\r\n- [HCV-GLUE](http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/hcvGlue/) - a GLUE project for hepatitis C virus (HCV)\r\n- [SRLV-GLUE](http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/SRLV/) - a GLUE project for small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV)\r\n- BTV-GLUE - a GLUE project for bluetongue virus (BTV)\r\n- HEV-GLUE - a GLUE project for hepatitis E virus (HEV)\r\n\r\n### **Authors and Contributors**\r\n\r\nRobert J. Gifford (robert.gifford@glasgow.ac.uk).\r\n\r\nJosh Singer (josh.singer@glasgow.ac.uk)",
