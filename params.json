  "body": "GLUE is a software package for developing nucleotide-level hypotheses about the evolution of virus genomes. It enables the dissemination of these hypotheses on the web and their utilisation in wider software systems. \r\n\r\n### **Design Overview**\r\n\r\nAt the heart of GLUEtools is an entity-relationship model which has been designed for representing:\r\n\r\n- Virus and EVE genome data\r\n- Phenotypic and other data associated with specific sequences\r\n- Genomic feature annotations\r\n- The nucleotide-level proposed evolutionary relationships between genomes\r\n- Configurable modules for manipulation and analysis of the data\r\n\r\nData hosted inside a GLUEtools instance is organised into independent projects. Typical activities associated with developing a GLUEtools project:\r\n\r\n- Import sequence data into GLUEtools from a public database or elsewhere\r\n- Define relevant additional sequence data fields and obtaining corrected / normalised values for these fields\r\n- Filter out certain sequences from the project\r\n- Select reference sequences and define genomic features on these references\r\n- Apply sequence alignment techniques to capture homologies between genome segments\r\n- Arrange data into evolutionary clades and define relationships between these clades\r\n- Define project-specific analysis modules\r\n\r\nOnce a project has been developed, it can be published as a web resource, which allows:\r\n\r\n- Dissemination of the project data, for example in conjunction with an academic publication\r\n- Utilisation of the project for automated sequence analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Current GLUE projects**\r\n\r\n- [HCV-GLUE](http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/hcvGlue/) - a GLUE project for hepatitis C virus (HCV)\r\n- SRLV-GLUE - a GLUE project for small ruminant Lentivirus (SRLV)\r\n- BTV-GLUE - a GLUE project for bluetongue virus (BTV)\r\n- HEV-GLUE - a GLUE project for hepatitis E virus (HEV)\r\n\r\n### **Authors and Contributors**\r\n\r\nRobert J. Gifford (robert.gifford@glasgow.ac.uk).\r\n\r\nJosh Singer (josh.singer@glasgow.ac.uk)",
